Filtering by resource attributes
You can filter resources by a specific attribute or tag. For example to display only instances that are in the stopped state

In the Search field, enter Instance State and select the attribute from the list that appears.

Select Instance state: stopped from the list of possible values.
This method is achieved using either API filtering or client filtering, depending on the selected resource attribute.
